# Snake Game
This is a basic snake game that I created mid 2022 while learning design petterns. It was not necessary (in fact, it was overkill) to use Visitor design patten in the project, but I did so as the aim of the project was to familiarize myself with design patterns.

### How to Run
Install JavaFX: Make sure you have JavaFX 17 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/).
Configure the BAT file: Open the build.bat file and replace the JAVAFX_HOME path with the actual installation directory of JavaFX on your machine.
Run the game: Double-click the build.bat file. This will compile the Java code and launch the game.
Note: If you encounter any issues, please check the JavaFX documentation for troubleshooting steps.
